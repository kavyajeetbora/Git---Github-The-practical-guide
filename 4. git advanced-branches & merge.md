# Git Branch & Merge

Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

**Note:** that all of the commands presented below merge into the current branch. The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected. Again, this means that git merge is often used in conjunction with git checkout for selecting the current branch and git branch -d for deleting the obsolete target branch

Here is a detailed [article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge) on git merge.

## Understanding merge types

There are mainly two types of merge in git:
- Fast forward merge
- non fast forward
    - recursive 
    - Octopus
    - ours
    - Subtree

Out of the above, most common type of merges are fast forward and recursive non fast forward

## Fast forward merge
the fast forward merge is the most common one. git uses fast forward when there is no additional commit in the master branch after the feature branch was created. 

A fast-forward merge can occur when there is a linear path from the current branch tip to the target branch. Instead of “actually” merging the branches, all Git has to do to integrate the histories is move (i.e., “fast forward”) the current branch tip up to the target branch tip. This effectively combines the histories, since all of the commits reachable from the target branch are now available through the current one

- **with fast forward merege, we dont create a new commit, we just move the pointer/header from the master to the lastest commit of the feature branch** 

**Merge changes into a new commit**

use `--squash` keyword: In Git, the term squash is used to squash the previous commits into one

When Head is in the master branch:
```
git merge --squash "feature_branch"
```
## Recursive type merge

Recursive unlike fast forward happens when there is single or multiple commits in master branch after creatiion of the feature branch. 

**This happens when the base for the two branches is no longer the same**:

To perform a recursive type merge:
```git 
git merge --no-ff "branch name"
```
Now the master branch log will consist of all the commits of the feature branch individually and also a new branch named "Merge branch 'feature', which is automatically created by git

The flag `--no-ff` is mentioned to explicitly tell git to merge without fast forward. But if we make any changes in the master branch after branching the feature branch and then we merge the branches to master, by default the recursive merge is used by git. 

If the base is same and we want to do the merge without fast-forward then:

```
git merge --no-ff feature
```
