GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration

# Connecting Git and Github - Local to Empty Remote Repository

First we need to keep in mind that `git` and `github` are two different indepent entity and they don't know anything about each other.

GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control. GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects

1. To establish connection between the local repository (developed using `git`) and remote repository in web hosting service like GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab etc:

```git 
git remote add origin url
```
here `url` is the url of the remote repository and `origin` in the short hand for that repository.

2. When we have the connection establised at place, we can now upload the changes to this remote repository:

```
git push 
```

3. Sometimes we may want information from the remote repository to our local repository, we can call:

```
git pull
```
These are high level concepts for connecting local and remote repos.

## Connecting the local repository to the remote repository

Here the remote repository is the repository in the cloud which is in our `github` account. 
 
1. First we make a remote repository in our github account.
2. The remote repository will have an unique address to it, we will use this address/url for connecting our local will remote
3. To connect with the remote, we type:
```
git remote add origin url_of_the_remote
```

## Pushing changes to remote repository

Here we need to mention the url of the remote repository along with the short-hand for it

4.  Now to push to the remote repository, we type:
```
git push origin master
```

What happens we `push` a repository from local to remote:

1. git creates a remote tracking branch is `remotes/origin/master`
2. Git creates a remote tracking branch.
3. Next question is what is `remote tracking branch` and how is it different from `remote branch`? : 
    - remote branches are branches in remote repo and local branches are the branches in local repo
    - remote tracking branch is a local copy of the remote branch suited in our local repository. In other words, remote tracking branch is just a local cache of the remote branch
    - With `git fetch` we can update the information of the remote branch into our remote traking branch
    - and to update the changes from remote branch to local repo, we need to merge the changes to one of our local branches.
    - or directly we can use `git pull origin master` this will `fetch` and `merge` the changes to one of our local branch

we can also see all the branches (remote and local) using:
```
git branch -a
```
We are displayed all the local branches and the remote branches.

## Pull from Remote branch

Suppose we want to update our changes in our local repository from our remote repository, here in this case if we want to see all the branches using 
```
git branch -a
```
all remote and local branches that are synced will only be displayed but not the branch that is created in the remote repo. So to list down all the remote branch:
```
git ls-remote
```
git fetch is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository. To update the changes from the remote to local, we can use:
```
git fetch origin
```
then git will create the remote branch in our local repo.

- We can also use `git pull` here but we need to specify the local branchname as well so as to tell git where to merge the changes to.
- Important to note is that `git pull` is combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`. So when using `git pull`:
```
git pull origin master
```

this means it will pull the changes from remote repo (`origin`) and merge the changes to the `master` branch in local repo.

## What is local tracking branch ? how is it different from remote tracking branch?

Local tracking branch is the branch that tracks the changes in the local repository and updates it to the remote tracking branch. whereas remote tracking branch tracks the changes of the remote repo and updates it to the local branch. To make a connection between the two:

1. First we create a remote tracking branch:

```
git push origin master
```
when we push the changes from local to remote then git creates a remote tracking branch: `remotes/origin/master`

2. the we create a local tracking branch:
```
git branch --track master origin/master
```
Here the name of the local and remote shall be same as convention. 
3. Switch to the local tracking branch:
```
git switch master
```
4. Any changes we make, we can add, commit and directly push the changes:
```
git push 
```
simply typing git push will know where to update the changes since we already had set up a connection between the local and the remote tracking branch. 
5. This also means that any changes that we make in our remote repo, we can update the changes in our local by:
```
git pull
```
So there is a flow pipeline setup between the local and remote repo this way.

## Some other usefull commands

1. To show detailed configuration
```
git remote show origin
```
2. List all local tracking branches with their remotes
```
git branch --vv
```

## Upstream 

For pushing the local changes to remote branch we can type:
```
git push -u origin branch_name
```
with `-u` flag denotes upstream, we create a local tracking branch automatically.

## Deleting branches and commits

### delete Branches

1. We have seen how to delete local branches:
```
git branch -D branch_name
```

2. To delete the remote tracking branch in working directory:
```
git branch --delete --remotes origin/branch_name
```
But remember this will only detele the remote tracking branch in our local working directory. But will not delete the remote branch in github (cloud)

3. To delete the remote branch:
```
git push origin --delete branch_name
```
this will delete the branch on github (remote repository)


4. Also deleting remote branch deletes the remote tracking branch

5. Deleting commits in local and remote repository

for undoing the commits:
```
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
Then with changes made in local, we can push this change to remote:
```
git push origin master
```
But we have to keep in mind that while doing so we don't interfere the remote repository as many collaborators may be working.


## Upstream

All we so far learnt about:
- How to add a remote branch
- How to connect the local and the remote branch
- How push the changes to remote from local and vice-versa using pull
- What are remote and local tracking branch and how to set up a flow connection between remote and local manually

But we can do this setup automatically just by mentioning `-u` flag while pushing changes:

```
git push -u origin master
```

This is automatically set up local and remote tracking branch for this master branch and the remote branch
