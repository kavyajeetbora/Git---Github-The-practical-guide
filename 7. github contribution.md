# Fork and pull request

A fork is a copy of a repository. It is a copy of remote repository of a user in another account which forked that repo.

Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

What is the difference between clone and fork ?

As the above diagram suggest, `git clone` is nothing but having a local copy by different users of the same organization or the users are collaborators.

But using `git fork`, we can contribute to the project without being part of the organization and fork the repo (meaning have a copy of the remote repo in our remote github account) and then we can work on it independently. After we make some changes in the code we can contribute to the original owner of the forked repo by creating a `pull request` on github.

creating a pull request:

The owner can then accept/merge the changes or reject the changes by closing our pull request. This example shows how owner is merging the pull request:
