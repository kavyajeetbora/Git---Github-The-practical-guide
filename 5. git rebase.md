# git `rebase`

## What is rebase ?

Rebasing is changing the base of your branch from one commit to another making it appear as if you'd created your branch from a different commit.

It is used when we want to merge the master with feature branch but while developing the feature branch we have new commits in the master branch. Then we:
1. simply rebase the base of the feature to the latest commit in the master branch. (also means rebase master into feature )
2. then merge the master with the feature. This move the head of the master to the latest commit in the feature.
3. Important thing to note is that when rebase of the feature branch is done, it creates a new copy of the feature branches.

**Syntax:**
(HEAD is at feature branch):
```git
git rebase master
```
## Rebase creates new commits

Internally, Git accomplishes this by creating new commits and applying them to the specified base. It's very important to understand that even though the branch looks the same, it's composed of entirely new commits.

Points to remember:
1. rebase means shifting of the base of a branch to another base
2. This creates a new commit meaning that the history is rewritten. The commit ids will be different now.
3. When commit ids are changed then it is ok when we are working in our local repository. But when working publically, the commit ids are changed and this could be difficult for other collaborators to access any previous commit.

## When to use to use `git rebase`:
1. When we have new commits while working in the feature branch
2. when the feature relies on the additional commits in the master branch
3. When the feature branch is finished developing and we want to implement it into master without merge commit: 
    - rebase master into feature (this wouldn't effec the master branch but **will change the ids of the feature branch commits**)
    - then merge the feature into master
