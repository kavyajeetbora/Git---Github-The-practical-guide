# Git fundamentals part 1

# what is git ?

It is a version control system. Basically used for tracking changes in the files automatically.

# Git Config:

For setting git configuration, we use:

```git
$ git config
```
The git config command is a convenience function that is used to set Git configuration values on a global or local project level. These configuration levels correspond to . gitconfig text files. Executing git config will modify a configuration text file

## Why configuration with name and email address?

These details are simply used as metadata in each commit so anyone viewing the Git log would know who committed the code and how to get in touch with them

Setting the git configuration:

1. username
2. email
3. default editor for git (default is Vim)

There are 3 different levels for configuring the git:
1. System level - settings applies to all users of the current computer
2. Global level - settings applies to all repository of current user
3. Local level - settings applies to current repository of current user

so we can have different settings for different projects

## Setting the default editor
We can choose our own default editor for our git commands. If not set then git uses the default editor as vim which is not very user friendly. Here we will use vscode as default editor for git:

```git
$ git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```
**Note:** 
- Before setting the editor, we need to add the vscode to path
- with `--wait` we tell the terminal window that "wait unit we close a new vs code instance".

## We can also view the settings in a txt file, to open it:

We can open our all the global settings in our default editor using:
```git
$ git config --global -e
```

## Setting the end of lines:
- in Windows end of line is `\r\n` and in mac it is `\n`
- if we dont handle end of line, there will be issues down the line

```git
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
```
We can take help about git commands using `--help` for more detailed help or `-h` for short help



## Initializing repository in the local computer

Go to the project folder where the verion controling is required

```git
cd "project folder location"
```
the type the following command:

```git
$git init
```

**What does `git init` exactly does?**

the git init will initialize the repository (which is responsible for tracking changes) and make the current working folder as the reference "working directory".
Any changes made to this working directory will be tracked by the git and will be stored in the repository.  

It is very important to note that the git doesnot create any copies of the same file to track changes. but only tracks the changes in the file (for example code). 

This will create a `.git` folder in your project folder. This is how git stores the history of your project. We dont have to touch it as it is used by the git in backgroud to track changes. That is why it is kept hidden.

## Git Workflow

Taking Snapshots: When we make a lot of changes in our project that changes are tracked by git and we can take the snapshots or save the changes by committing it that will push the files with updated changes to the local/remote repository.

Staging area: This is an area in between the local directory and committing the changes. It is where we can review the changes before committing.

## Staging area

to check which are files are already added to the staging area:

```git 
git ls-files
```

The usefulness of staging area is if we make a total of 3 changes, and suppose after reviewing it we have to approved only 2 out of 3 changes, then we can unstage the unwanted one and commit the rest of the changes. 

Here an important concept is that the working directory and the reposistory are two different terms. The working directory is where we keep our files. repository is a default git's part which tracks the changes. It consists of two different parts - staging area and commit area. 

To save the changes and push the changes to staging area we use:

```git
git add file.py
```

Note: After committing the changes, the staging area will store the latest updated file unless we make the changes in the staging area

## Git Commit

```git
git commit -m "inital upload"
```

Once the changes are committed to the repository, then the changes are tracked behind the scenes by git. A image showing how the changes are tracked:

With this we can also revert back to previous revision if there is any bugs found in the new one. 

Each git commit will consist of:
1. ID
2. Message of the commit 
3. Date/Time
4. Author by whom the changes were made
5. And the complete snapshot of the changes

One important thing to remember is that the git stores the complete updated project not only the changes to it. With this it can restore the project state very quickly. while storing the complete project at each commit, it compresses the content and doesnot store duplicates.

If we want to see all the git commits, we can use `git log`:

## Git log

```git
git commit
```
This returns: 
```git

This is will give information about each commit and along with the commit id

**Note:** The git log remains in "open" mode. To exit the git log command press `q` button

## Git branching 

- suppose we want to add a new feature in our existing project without interfering with running project that is on `master` branch. 
- We can create a new branch that will create a copy of the master branch. This branch will be an independent copy and git will track changes made to this file only on this branch and not interfere with the `master` branch

1. to create a branch:
```git 
git branch "branch name"
```
2. to see all the branches in the repository:

```git
git branch
```
3. To switch to a branch, we use:
```git
git checkout "branch-name"
```
or new command which more explicit and recommended:
```
git switch new_branch
```
if we want to switch and create a new branch at all once:
```git
git switch -c new-branch
```

## Git merge

From the current branch we can directory merge the other branches using:

```git
git merge "branch_name"
```

This will merge the files together

## What are Head and detached head in GIT ?

head is nothing but reference to the latest commit of the checkedout branch. 

If we switch to a different branch, then the head becomes latest commit of that branch.

We can checkout the head for the current branch using 

```git 
git log
```
output:
```git 
commit f6724f1b4eb99b4247b4c58f40780fccb36dffa5 (HEAD -> master, new_feature)
Author: Kavyajeet Bora <KVBA@ramboll.com>
Date:   Mon Aug 15 11:50:41 2022 +0530

    'Doesnot have a commit checkout' issue fixed

commit 35878b96e2df80ab44419b7a0b5e2e7aeae4cdd6
Author: Kavyajeet Bora <KVBA@ramboll.com>
Date:   Mon Aug 15 11:43:22 2022 +0530

<<<<<<< HEAD
    new branch

```
Here we can see the head is nothing but a pointer to the latest commit of the current branch.

When we directly switch to the commit unique ID of any branch, then we get detached head state:

```git 
git checkout f6724f1b4eb99b4247b4c58f40780fccb36dffa5
```
output:

```git 
Note: switching to 'f6724f1b4eb99b4247b4c58f40780fccb36dffa5'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental 
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.      

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at f6724f1 'Doesnot have a commit checkout' issue fixed
M       notes - git basic concepts.md
```

With  this we are not in any of the branch but a temporary branch that git creates:
```git 
git branch
```
output:
```git 
* (HEAD detached at f6724f1)
  master
  new_feature
  udemy
```
We can switch back to a branch using `checkout` to a branch.
